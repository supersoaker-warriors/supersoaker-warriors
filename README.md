# OkDoodle

#####Imagine a dating site where you could showcase your creative ability. Say you could express yourself in a form of a doodle. If so, look no further.

## Summary
OkDoodle is a social discovery application which allows users to find connections based their doodles. Unlike other dating applications which focus on users uploading photos of themselves and selecting each other based on superficial features, OkDoodle lets users, instead, to show their creative sides. Instead of uploading photos, users draw doodles. If two users like each other's doodles, they can connect. 

## Problem
Match-making sites where users browse through dozens of photos of potential matches are a dime a dozen. We believe that this over-reliance on superficial attributes sets unrealistic expectations and actually makes find matches more difficult. Research shows that customers tend to reject potential matches more quickly when their photos are available.

##Solution
OKDoodle allows users find matches based on their creativity, artistic ability, and sense of humor all while being extremely simple and elegant.
